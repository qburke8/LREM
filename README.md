# LREM

The low-cost respirator evaluation mechanism, or LREM, is aimed at supporting the development of innovative and alternative mask designs and materials with a cheaper and more accessible testing device. The device utilizes two sensors in its design. These are a DLLR-L10D-E1BD-C-NAV7 differential pressure sensor and two Sensirion SPS30 particulate matter sensors. These sensors are both connected to the same Arduino Mega 2560. This sketch combines skecthes and libraries found on GitHub for each sensor into one.
